However, if we do not use random_state, data is split differently at each time and according to split accuracy will be different. Therefore, we can conclude that model performance is dependent on train_test_split. For example you split, fit and predict data 5 times and accuracies are 0.89, 0.9, 0.91, 0.92 and 0.93, respectively. Which accuracy do you use?

If linear regression thinks that one of the feature is important, it gives high coefficient to this feature. However, this can cause overfitting that is like memorizing in KNN.

Also it is called L2 regularization. \n    * Ridge regression lost fuction = OLS + alpha * sum(parameter^2)\n    * alpha is parameter we need to choose to fit and predict. Picking alpha is similar to picking K in KNN. As you understand alpha is hyperparameter that we need to choose for best accuracy and model complexity. This process is called hyperparameter tuning.\n    * What if alpha is zero? lost function = OLS so that is linear rigression :)\n    * If alpha is small that can cause overfitting\n    * If alpha is big that can cause underfitting. But do not ask what is small and big. These can be change from problem to problem.\n* Lasso regression: Second regularization technique. Also it is called L1 regularization. \n    * Lasso regression lost fuction = OLS + alpha * sum(absolute_value(parameter))\n    * It can be used to select important features od the data.
